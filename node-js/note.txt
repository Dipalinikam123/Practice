# what is HTTP?
 => HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol used for transferring data over the web. It facilitates communication between web browsers and servers, allowing users to access websites, images, videos, and other content. When you enter a URL in your browser, it sends an HTTP request to the server hosting that content, which then responds with the requested data. HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the internet.

# what HTTP module do?
