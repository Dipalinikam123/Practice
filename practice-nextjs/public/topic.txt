----------------**** Routing ****-------------------
  - In next js Routing support file based routing.
  - folder name defines path name.
  
  1. Nested Routing :- login/studentlogin/page.jsx , path - localhost:3000/login/studentlogin
  2. Route Group - (course)/java/page.jsx, path - localhost:3000/java , [no need to write course]
  3. Dynamic Route [slug]-  user/[id]/page.jsx - path-user/1,  to get id from path use direct {params}  as a props
  4. catch all route /  catch all segment:-  blog/[...post]/page.jsx- path- blog/anything/anything/anything like- blog/post/mobile/vivo/part2, 
         this is  catch all segment add multiple path its work on all, --- to get that segment use {params} as a props it will return array {post:['post','mobile','vivo',;part2']}
  5. Optional route- blog/[[...post]]/page.jsx , no need to write post in path , you just write /blog still you can access page.jsx page 
          in Optional route. if you want to write post still this is work.
  6. Parallel route:- Parallelroute/@left/page.jsx or Parallelroute/@right/page.jsx

--------------------**** Layout ****-------------------
   You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.js file. The component should accept a children prop that will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a page during rendering.
              admin/profile/page.jsx & admin/dashboard/page.jsx & admin/layout.js path -/admin,, whatever you write in layout its shows on all admin children.

--------------------**** Linking and Navigation ****-------------------

There are four ways to navigate between routes in Next.js
  1.Using the <Link> Component.--- use:- <Link href="/login">Login</Link>
  2.Using the useRouter hook (Client Components) use:- const route=useRouter(), onclick={()=>route.push('/login)}
  3.Using the redirect function (Server Components) use :-  const flag =true; flag && redirect('/product')
  4.Using the native History API
 
--------------------**** Server and Cilent component  Rendering ****-------------------
1 . Server Component:- 
   -Render On Server Side 
   -By default all component are server Component
   - They Are Closer To Backend
   -So backend related logic and code should write in server components

1 . Client Component:- 
   -Render On Client Side 
   -can make client component with 'use client' directive.
   -all UI-related code amd events should be written here
